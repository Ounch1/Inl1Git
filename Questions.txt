The two common methods to revert code is git revert and git reset

git reset:

Resets the current branch to a specified commit, discarding changes.
When to Use: Use when you want to completely undo the commits after a certain point and discard those changes.
Example Commands:

git reset --hard <commit_hash>
Output: The working directory and staging area are reverted to a specified commit, --hard discards changes irreversibly, but there is --soft and --mixed.

git revert:

Purpose: Creates a new commit that undoes changes made in a previous commit.
When to Use: Use when you want to keep a record of the undo operation and maintain the commit history.
Example Commands:

git revert <commit_hash>
git commit -m "Revert changes made in <commit_hash>"

Output: A new commit is created that undoes the changes of the specified commit. This method is safer for shared branches as it doesn't rewrite history.
