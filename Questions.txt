I'd be pretty happy if i were to get a VG:

The two common methods to revert code is git revert and git reset

git reset:

Resets the current branch to a specified commit, discarding changes.
When to Use: Use when you want to completely undo the commits after a certain point and discard those changes.
--hard discards changes irreversibly, but there is also --soft and --mixed.

Example Commands:

git reset --hard <commit_hash>

Output: 
HEAD is now at e0c7828 Removing the .class files from the repository, adding a script file

git revert:

Purpose: Creates a new commit that undoes changes made in a previous commit.
When to Use: Use when you want to keep a record of the undo operation and maintain the commit history.
This method is safer for shared branches as it doesn't rewrite history.

Example Commands:

git revert <commit_hash>
git commit -m "Revert changes made in <commit_hash>"

Output: 
commit 453c3d2b5cfd46721472ba93c2a3b1720f67f9b5 (HEAD -> main)
